## Prerequisites

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK):** Version 8 or higher is recommended. [8]
*   **JavaFX SDK:** For JDK 11 and above, JavaFX is not bundled. You'll need to download the OpenJFX SDK and configure it with your IDE or build tool. [8]
*   **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):** An IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse is highly recommended for efficient development. [8]
*   **(Optional) Database Management System:** For data persistence, a DBMS like MySQL or SQLite is required. Ensure it's installed and accessible. [5, 8]

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```
    *(Replace `<repository_url>` with the actual GitHub repository URL.)*

2.  **Set up JavaFX:** Configure your IDE to recognize and use the JavaFX SDK as a library dependency. Refer to your IDE's documentation for specific instructions.

3.  **Database Setup (if applicable):**
    *   Install your chosen database system (e.g., SQLite, MySQL).
    *   Create the necessary database and tables according to the project's schema.
    *   Configure the application's connection settings to point to your database.

4.  **Build and Run the Application:**
    *   Open the project in your IDE.
    *   Build the project to compile all source files and resolve dependencies.
    *   Locate and run the main application class (e.g., `MainApp.java`).
